# ECEN751_project
### This project needs runing with [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org), [keras](https://keras.io) and  [cleverhand](https://github.com/openai/cleverhans.git)
*  Project1 notebook demonstrate the main training process
*  Reload contains the process of generating adversarial examples and test for each well trained networks
*  Project_adv_training.ipynb contains training the G_11 with generative adversarial examples
*  JSMA_ADV.ipynb shows how to use [Jacobian-based saliency map approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07528).
